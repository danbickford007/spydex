## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add spydex to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:spydex, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure spydex is started before your application:

          [applications: [:spydex]]
        end
